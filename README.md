# GDClass
A random equation was generated, then Linear Regression was implemented from scratch using Gradient Descent, Mini Batch Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent, using object-oriented programming, all with Regularization.

Results from this model were then compared to the results from the Sklearn Linear Model Python library, to test accuracy of the model.
